
# Azure Quote & Application Platform

A scalable, event-driven, serverless architecture built on Microsoft Azure — designed to simulate a real-world quote and application system, similar to platforms used by financial firms.

---

## Business Overview

This project demonstrates how to architect, deploy, and manage a modular financial application using Azure. The platform allows customers to request quotes, submit applications, and receive notifications — all while maintaining performance, security, and cost-efficiency.

---

## High-Level Flow

1. A customer visits the website or mobile app.
2. Inputs are sent to Azure API Management.
3. Data flows through microservices:
   - Validates customer input.
   - Generates a quote.
   - Stores the application data.
   - Sends a notification.
4. All services are event-driven and loosely coupled.

## Architecture Components

| Component               | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure API Management    | Exposes public-facing secure API endpoints                           |
| Azure Function Apps     | Each Function = one microservice (quote, validation, app, notify)    |
| Azure Service Bus       | Secure, reliable messaging between microservices (event-driven)      |
| Azure Cosmos DB         | Durable, scalable data storage for quotes and applications           |
| Azure Front Door        | Optional: Add later for global load balancing & security             |
| Azure Key Vault         | Securely store API keys, DB strings, secrets                         |
| Azure Entra ID (AAD)    | Secure identity and access control (RBAC, Managed Identity)          |
| GitHub Actions          | CI/CD pipeline for Terraform deployment                              |
| Terraform               | Infrastructure-as-Code for repeatable, scalable provisioning         |

## Microservices (Azure Function Apps)

Each service is a separate Azure Function for modularity and independence:

- **quote-service** – Calculates quotes based on customer input.
- **application-service** – Stores the final application in Cosmos DB.
- **validation-service** – Cleans and verifies submitted data.
- **notification-service** – Sends confirmation messages via SendGrid or Twilio.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Messaging:** Azure Service Bus
- **Architecture Style:** Event-driven, Serverless-first, loosely coupled
- **Security:** Entra ID (AAD), HTTPS, Key Vault, least privilege

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

This solution includes full-stack observability and diagnostics across key services:

| Component           | Monitoring Tool        | Observability Features                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Function Apps | Application Insights   | Logs, failures, live metrics, custom traces             |
| Azure Service Bus   | Azure Monitor          | Queue length, DLQ monitoring, message flow diagnostics  |
| Cosmos DB           | Azure Monitor          | Request units (RU) consumption, availability metrics    |
| API Management      | Built-in Analytics     | Request count, success rate, latency, usage patterns    |
| CI/CD Pipeline      | GitHub Actions Logs    | Workflow execution logs and deployment feedback         |

Alerts and thresholds can be configured for error spikes, queue backlogs, or performance drops. This ensures proactive error tracking and continuous improvement.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rrichley/azure-quote-platform.git
   ```

2. Set GitHub Actions secrets for Terraform:
   - `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
   - `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
   - `ARM_TENANT_ID`

3. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger deployment.
