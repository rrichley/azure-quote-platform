# API Security Architecture

Security is a core pillar of the Azure Quote Platform design. The following principles and implementations ensure strong protection.

## Core Security Areas

### Authentication
- Enforced via Azure Entra ID
- OAuth2 tokens or client credentials flow

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Future: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

### Logging and Auditing
- Function Apps integrated with Azure Monitor
- Activity logs and diagnostic settings enabled

### Secrets Management
- Azure Key Vault used to store:
  - API keys
  - DB connection strings
  - Credentials

### Communication Security
- All APIs use HTTPS endpoints
- Function bindings encrypted in transit

### Exception Management
- Custom error handling at API layer
- Alerting via Azure Monitor

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Cosmos DB and Storage Queues are encrypted
- No sensitive data exposed in logs

### Cryptography
- AES-256 encryption for all storage
- Key rotation supported via Key Vault

### Compliance
- Aligned with Microsoft Azure Security Baseline
- ISO 27001 and ISO 25010 considerations embedded
