# API Quality - ISO/IEC 25010 Standards

This document outlines how the API architecture adheres to ISO/IEC 25010 software quality standards:

## Functional Suitability
- **Completeness:** APIs meet all intended user tasks and objectives.
- **Correctness:** APIs provide accurate outputs for given inputs.
- **Appropriateness:** APIs are efficient for achieving required tasks.

## Usability
- **Learnability:** Easy for developers to understand and use.
- **Operability:** Well-documented and intuitive endpoints.
- **User Protection:** Input validation to prevent user-side errors.

## Reliability
- **Maturity:** Designed for stable performance under normal usage.
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime target using Azure availability features.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Redundancy through queues, retries, and auto-healing.
- **Recoverability:** Geo-redundant architecture and backup strategies.

## Performance Efficiency
- **Time Behavior:** Optimized API latency using Function Apps + caching.
- **Resource Utilization:** Auto-scaling serverless architecture.
- **Capacity:** Built to handle peak quote + application loads.

## Security
- Aligned with SDL principles and OWASP top 10.
- End-to-end encryption.
- Identity control via Entra ID and Key Vault.

## Maintainability
- **Modularity:** APIs separated into microservices.
- **Reusability:** Independent and deployable services.
- **Analyzability:** Logs and metrics collected for review.
- **Modifiability:** Easy to extend with minimal impact.
- **Testability:** Unit + integration testing built into CI/CD.

## Portability
- Easily migrated across environments using Terraform IaC.
